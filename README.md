Tools Breakdown:

-HTML5 Geolocation API = finds the user's current location and automatically updated the user's location as they move throughout JSC

-Google Maps API and Google Maps Directions API = enables users to navigate from building marker to building marker by overlaying travel                                                     directions on the Google Map.

-Snazzy Maps = Used to style the Google Map of JSC into a light green.

-Lighthouse Chrome Extension = when used, Lighthouse will run an audit on your Progressive Web App and give it a rating depending on how                                  "progressive" your website is.

-Bootstrap Framework = I used bootstrap to design the website and add interactivity



**Note: The Google Maps API only works with HTTPS**
